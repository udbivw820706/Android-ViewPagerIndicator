Android ViewPagerIndicator
==========================

Port of [Patrik Åkerfeldt][1]'s paging indicators that are compatible with the
ViewPager from the [Android Compatibility Library][2] and
[ActionBarSherlock][3].




Usage
=====

*For a working implementation of this project see the `sample/` folder.*

  1. Include one of the widgets in your view. This should usually be placed
     adjacent to the `ViewPager` it represents.

        <com.jakewharton.android.viewpagerindicator.TitlePageIndicator
            android:id="@+id/title_indicator"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_width="fill_parent" />

  2. In your `onCreate` method (or `onCreateView` for a fragment), bind the
     indicator to the `ViewPager`.

         //Set the pager with an adapter
         ViewPager pager = (ViewPager)findViewById(R.id.pager);
         pager.setAdapter(new TestAdapter(getSupportFragmentManager()));

         //Bind the title indicator to the adapter
         TitlePageIndicator titleIndicator = (TitlePageIndicator)findViewById(R.id.titles);
         titleIndicator.setViewPager(pager);

     *Note*: If you are using `TitlePageIndicator` your adapter must implement
     `TitleProvider`.

  3. *(Optional)* If you use an `OnPageChangeListener` with your view pager
     you should set it in the indicator rather than on the pager directly.

         //continued from above
         titleIndicator.setOnPageChangeListener(mPageChangeListener);
